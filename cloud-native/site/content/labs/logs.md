title: Logs
---

In this exercise, you will view logs for your application and instrumentation for distributed tracing.

## CLI Logs

Cloud Foundry aggregates logs related to your application.  These include logs for components related to calls to your application.

The browser app has been instrumented using <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/1.0.9.RELEASE/" target="_blank">Spring Cloud Sleuth</a>.  This adds span information to your logs and can be easily hooked up to external systems for consumption.

### Tailing Logs

* Use `cf logs` to tail logs for your browser application.
* Issue a few requests through the web interface.

You should see logs from the application but also the Router component of CF.

```sh
2016-05-20T12:50:59.07-0600 [RTR/5] <-- RTR is the Router.
```

Also note:

```sh
2016-05-20T12:52:11.07-0600 [APP/0]      OUT 2016-05-20 18:52:11.068  INFO [browser,92ca8a46b9903cdc,92ca8a46b9903cdc,true]
```

The section `[browser,92ca8a46b9903cdc,92ca8a46b9903cdc,true]` is instrumented by Spring Cloud Sleuth.  You are seeing [app-name, spanID, traceID].

This info is also available in the browser UI.

> Notice that cloud foundry automatically treats your application logs as streams and makes them easily accessible: http://12factor.net/logs

### Working with Zipkin

We have pushed four microservice applications that use Spring Cloud Slueth with an external [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) service.

In the previous section you have seen span and trace ids in the application logs lets see how zipkin works with this inromation.

Let's start a trace by sending a request to our Acme Finacial UI. <a href="/start" target="_blank">Start Trace!</a>

Now lets take a look at what it looks like in <a href="Zipkin" target="_blank">Zipkin</a>.

  - From the Zipkin UI make sure you are on the `Find a trace` tab.
  - Select acme-financial-ui
    - then select Find Traces
  - Select a trace.

Let's Digest some of this information.

From the trace, take note of the number of spans made, the number of services called, and how long it took for the trace to finish.

Lets take a look at the Spans.

![spans](/img/spans.png)


After we send our initial request to the ui what methods are called?

What happens in the back-office service?

## Understanding the trace hierarchy

In your browser Navigate to the<a href="/dependency" target="_blank">dependencies</a> or your traces.

Lets check out the hierachy.

When the initial request is sent to the **UI** a  call to the **back-office-microservice** is made which then gets data from the **account-microservice** and the **customer-mircroservice**.

## Beyond the Class

* Stream Application Logs to <a href="https://papertrailapp.com" target="_blank">Papertrail</a> via <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html" target="_blank">these instructions.</a>
* Use PCF Metrics to view detailed information about your app: <a href="http://docs.run.pivotal.io/metrics/using.html" target="_blank">docs.run.pivotal.io/metrics/using.html</a>
* Deploy the Microservices Dashboard: <a href="https://github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard" target="_blank">github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard</a>
<!-- * Use <a href="http://start.spring.io" target="_blank">start.spring.io</a> to generate a zipkin server.  <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2016/02/15/distributed-tracing-with-spring-cloud-sleuth-and-spring-cloud-zipkin" target="_blank">Deploy it to CF </a> and hook it up to your microservices. -->
